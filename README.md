You can find it in [Telegram](https://web.telegram.org/k/) by the name @pseudo_human_bot!   
Although I must say that it's not running now, so you won't get any answer.

## About the project
The project was developed for "Exploratory programming" of Systems Engineering, and consists of the design and implementation of a conversational agent using the Rasa framework and following integration with the Telegram API.

## Characteristics
The scope of the agent is set to be within a Telegram study group, where it must simulate being me in the context of a college student. The agent has the ability to engage in small talk with other members and plan group meetings based on both its own personal schedule and others. Besides, it can capture participants feelings and utilize them within the conversation context, being able to provide personal treatment to every member.   
Lastly, the bot has the ability to debate about topics that come up in the conversation, showing its knowledge and even giving its own opinion if the topic being discussed is known to him.
